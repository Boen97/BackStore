## IPv4 Addressing

- a host typically has a single link into the network
- the boundary between the host and the physical link is called interface.
- a router has many links
- The boundary between the router and any one of its links is also called an interface.
- a router has multiple interfaces, one for each of its links.
- IP requires each host and router interface to have its own IP address
- IP address is technically associate with an interface, rather than with the host or router containing that interface.

- each IP address is 32-bits long (4 bytes) a total of 2^32 about 4 billion possible IP addresses

- IP address are typically written in dotted-decimal notation
  - 192.32.216.9
  - 11000001 00100000 11011000 00001001

- each interface in the global Internet must have an IP address that is global unique. (except for interfaces behind NATs)
