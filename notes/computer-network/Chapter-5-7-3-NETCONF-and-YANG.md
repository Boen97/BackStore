## The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) and YANG

- the NETCONF protocol operates between the managing server and the managed devices.
- providing messaging to 
1. retrieve, set, and modify configuration data at managed devies.
2. to query operational data and statistics at managed devices.
3. to subscribe to notifications generated by managed devices.

- the managing server actively controls a managed device by sending it configurations
- which are specified in a XML document

- NETCONF uses a remote procedure call (RPC) paradigm
- where protocol messages are encoded in XML
- and exchanged between the managing server and managed device over a TLS protocol.

- NETCONF support mutlti-device transactions
