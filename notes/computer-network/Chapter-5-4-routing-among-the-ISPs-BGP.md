## Routing among the ISPs: BGP (Border Gateway Protocal - inter-AS protocal)

> to router a packet across multiple ASs, say from a smartphone to a server, we need an **inter-autonomous system routing protocol**

> since an inter-AS routing protocol involves coordination among multiple ASs, communicating ASs must run the same inter-AS routing protocol.

> in fact, in the Internet, all ASs run the same inter-AS routing protocol, called the BGP (Border Gateway protocal)

- BGP is arguably the most important of all the Internet Protocals (the only other contender would be the IP protocal)
- as it is the protocal that glues the thousands of ISPs in the Internet together.

> BGP is a decentralized and asynchronous protocal in the vein of distance-vector routing.
