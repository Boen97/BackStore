> the community believes that the goal is connectivity, the tool is the Internet Protocol, and the intelligence is end to end rather then hidden in the network.

## The IP Hourglass.

> illustrates the narrow waist of the layered Internet architecture.

- while the Internet has many protocols in the physical, link, transport, and application layers,
- there is only one network layer protocol-the IP protocol.
> this is the one protocol that must be implemented by each and every of the billions of Internet-connectd services.
> the relative simplicity of the IP protocol, and the fact that it is the only universal requirement for Internet connectivity
> from Ethernet to WiFi to cellular to optical networks to become part of the Internet.

> the role of the narrow waist, which refers to as a spanning layer: 
- present a uniform service interface to the applications above.
- it defines a basic set of services, which were carefully designed 
- so that they could be constructed from a wide range of underlying network technologies.
- Software, as a part of the Internet layer, translates what each of these lower-layer technologies offers into the common service of the Internet layer.

## The end-to-end argument

> intelligence is end to end rather than hidden in the network - speaks to the placement of funcionality within the network.

- most Internet functionality was indeed placed at the network's edge.

> the endpoints (TCP protocol) must perfomed error control
