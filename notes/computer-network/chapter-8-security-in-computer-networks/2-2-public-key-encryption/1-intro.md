# Public Key Encryption

- one difficult of  `symmetric key` is two parties must somehow agree on the shared keys
- `but to do so in itself requires secure communication. `

## the use of public key cryptography

- `public key`
: public key is available to `everyone` in the world

- `private key`
: only known to recipient

## one concern

- anyone can send an encrypted message to recipient
- a `digital signature` is needed to `bind` a sender to a message.
