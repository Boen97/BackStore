# Security in Computer Networks

## the desirable properties of `secure communication`
1. Confidentiality
: only the sender and intended receiver should be able to understand the contents of the transmitted message.
: the message should be `encrypted`
: `secure communication`

2. Message integrity
: ensure the transmitted message not altered.
: the checksumming techniques can be used to provide such message integrity

3. End-point authentication
: both the sender and receiver should be able to confirm the `identity` of the other party.

4. Operational security
: `operational devices` such as `firewalls` and `intrusion detection systems` are used to counter attacks against an organization's network
: a `firewall` sits between the organization's network and the public network,
: controlling packet access to and from the network
: a `intrusion detecting system` performs deep packet inspection

## what `information` an `intruder` may hava access to and what `action` can be taken by the `intruder`

- an intruder can potentially perform:
1. eavesdropping-sniffing and recording control and data messages on the channel.
2. modification, insertion, or deletion of messages or message content
