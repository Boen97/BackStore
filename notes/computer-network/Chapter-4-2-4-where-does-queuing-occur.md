## where does queuing occur

> packets queues may form at both the input ports and the output ports

- the queuing depends on the traffic load, the switching fabric, the line speed
- when buffers are full, then packet loss will occur.

### Input Queuing

> the switch fabric is not fase enough (relative to the input lien speed)

- if two packets at the front of queues are destined for the same output queue
-
