# Introducing Classes
> the class defines the shape and nature of an object.
> it forms the basis for object-oriented programming.

## Class Fundamentals

> a class defines a **new data type**
> a class is a **template** for an object.
> an object is an **instance** of a class.

### The General form of a Class.

1. the data it contains
2. the code that operates on that data.

> a class's code defines the interface to its data.

> **instance variables**
: the data or variables defined within a class

> **methods**

> **members**
: the methods and variables defined within a class are called **members of the class**

- variables defined within a class called **instance variables**
- because each instance of the class contains its own copy of these variables.
