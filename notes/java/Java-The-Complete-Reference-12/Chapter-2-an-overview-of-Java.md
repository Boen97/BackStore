## Object-Oriented Programming
- the core of Java
- best understand the principles of OOP

### Two paradigms

> all computer languages consist of two elements: **code** and **date**
> there are two paradigms that how a program constructed
1. process-oriented model
   : a series of linear steps
   : **code acting on data**
2. object-oriented model
   : data controlling access to code.
   : organize a program around its data
   : a set of well-definded interface to the data.
   : switching the controlling entity to data （操作的主体都是对象，例如张三吃饭，张三是对象，吃饭是Code，主体一直是对象）
   
### Abstraction
> an essential element of OOP is abstraction.
> **humans manage complexity through abstraction.**
> people don't think a car as a set of individual parts, they think it is a well-defined object with its own unique behaviour.
> people can ignore the details of the car, and just drive.

**manage abstraction**
> through the use of hierarchical classifications.
- For Example
: a car is a single object
: inside the car consists of several subsystems
: each of these subsystems is made more specific units.
: you can manage the complexity of the car through the use of hierarchical abstraction

### The Three OOP Principles
> All object-oriented programming languages provide mechanism that help you implement the object-oriented model.
1. encapsulation
   : encapsulation complexity
   : everyone knows how to access it and then use it regardless of the implementation details
   : and without fear of unexpected side effect.
   : 相同的封装，让不同的实现和迭代更为简单方便
2. inheritence
3. polymorphism
