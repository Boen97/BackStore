to fully understand Java, one must understand the reasons behind its creation, the forces that shaped it, and the legacy that it inherits.

like the successful computer languages that came before, Java is a blend of the best elements of its rich heritage combinded with the innovative concepts
required by its unique mission.

This Chapters talk about 
1. how and why Java came about.
2. why Java is so important.
3. how it has evovled over the years.

although Java has become inseparatly linked with the online environment of the Internet,
it is important to remember that Java is first and foremost a programming language.

computer languages innovation and development occurs for two fundamental reasons:
1. to adapt to changing environments and uses.
2. to implement refinements and imporvements in the art of programming.

## Java's Lineage
1. Java is related to C++, which is a direct descendant of C.
2. From C, Java derives the syntax.
3. Many of Java's object-oriented features were influenced by C++.
4. moreover, the creation of Java was deeply rooted in the process of refinement and adaptation that has been occuring in computer programming languages
   for the past serveral decades.
5. each innovation in language design was driven by the the need to solve a fundamental problem that the preceding languages could not solve.

## The birth of Modern Programming: C
> the creation of C was a direct result of the need for a structured, efficient, high-level language
> that could replace assembly code when creating system programs.

trade-offs are made during the language design:
1. easy-of-use vs power.
2. safety vs efficiency
3. rigidity vs extensibility

assembly language can be used to produce highly efficient programs, but it is not easy to learn or use efficiently.
further, debugging assembly code could be very difficult

early computer languages such as BASIC, FORTRAN were not designed around structured principles.
as a result, programs written using these languages tend to produce "spaghetti code**
a mass of tangled jumps and conditional branches that make a program virtually impossible to understand

C was started with a older language called BCPL which are called B
C was formally standardized in December 1989
C have marked the beginning of the modern age of computer languages.
**C was a programmer's language.**

## C++: The Next Step

since C is a successful and useful language, why a need for something else existed.
The answer is **complexity**, programs are larger and more complex
With structured language, once a project reaches a certain size, its complexity exceeds what a programmer can manage.
To solve this problem, **OOP (object-oriented programming)** was intruduced.
> OOP is a programming methdology that helps organize complex programs through the use of **inheritence**, **encapsulation**, **polymorphism**

> C++ was invented in 1979, first was called "C with Classes", then changed to "C++", extends C by adding object-oriented features.
