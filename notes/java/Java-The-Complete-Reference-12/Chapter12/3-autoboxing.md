> autoboxing and auto-unboxing

> they are very important to **generics**, which are operate only on objects

```java
Integer i = 100; // autoboxing
int ii = i; // auto-unboxing
```

> each autobox and auto-unbox adds overhead than primitive type

> you should restrict your use of the type wrappers to only those cases in which an object representation of a primitive type is required. 

> Autoboxing/unboxing was not added to Java as a “back door” way of eliminating the primitive types.
