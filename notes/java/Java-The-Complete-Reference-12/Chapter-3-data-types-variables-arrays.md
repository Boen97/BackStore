- Java is a strongly typed language.

## The Primitive Types
- Java defines eight primitive types of data
1. byte
2. short
3. int 
4. long
5. char
6. float
7. double
8. boolean
- the primitive types are also commonly referred to as **simple types**

- four groups
1. Integers
   : byte
   : short
   : int
   : long
2. Floating-point numbers
   : float
   : double
3. Characters
   : char
4. Boolean

- primitive types are not complex object, but single value
  : although Java is object-oriented, the primitive types are not
  : the reason for this is **efficiency**

- primitive types have explicit range and mathematical behavior
  : in C++ and C, the interger size are based upon execution environment
  : in Java, all data types have a strictly defined range
  : while strictly specifying the size of an interger may cause a small loss of performance
    it is necessary to achieve portability.

### Integers.

- all of interger types are signed, positive and negative values.
