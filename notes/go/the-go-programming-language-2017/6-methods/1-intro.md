# Methods

- an `object` is simply a value or variable that has `methods`
- and a `method` is a function associated with a particular type.
- a legacy from early object-oriented languages that describes calling a method as `sending a message to an object`
- in Go, we don't use a special name like `this` or `self` for the `receiver`
- we choose receiver names just as we would for any other `parameter`

- It is often convenient to define additional behaviors for simple types such as
- numbers, strings, slices, maps, and sometimes even functions.
