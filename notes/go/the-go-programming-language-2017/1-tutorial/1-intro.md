- Go was conceived in 2007 and announced in 2009 with googles.

> it has automatic memory management or garbage collection.

> Go is well suited for building infrastructure like networked servers, and tools and systems for programmers

> it has become popular as a replacement for untyped scripting language

> Go typically run faster than programs written in dynamic language, and suffer far fewer crashes due to unexpected type errors.

## The Origins of Go

> Go is sometimes described as a C-like language or C for the 21st century

- from C, Go inherited its expression syntax, control-flow statements, basic data types, call-by-value parameter passing, pointers.
- above all, C's emphasis on programs that compile to efficient machine code
- and cooperate with the abstractions of current operating system.
