# Declarations

> a `declaration` names a program entity and specifies some or all of its properties.

- there are four major kinds of declarations: `var`, `const`, `type`, and `func`

## a Go program file

- each file begins with a `package` declaration that says what package the file is part of.
- import declarations
- a sequence of a `package-level` declarations of types, variables, constants ...

- the name of each package-level entity is visible
- not only throughout the source file
- but throughout all the files of the package.
