# Html Basics

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

- The `<head>` element contains `meta information` about the HTML page
- <body> is a container for all the visible contents

## The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration

- helps browsers to display web page correctly
- must appear once, at the top of the page
- not case sensitive
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration for `HTML5`

## HTML Elements

- The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
- <br> have no content, these elements are called empty elements
- Empty elements do not have an end tag!

## <html>

- The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.

## HTML is Not Case Sensitive

- <P> means the same as <p>.
- W3C recommends lowercase in HTML
- demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.
