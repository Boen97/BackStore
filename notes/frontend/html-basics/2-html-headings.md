# HTML Headings

## <h1> to <h6>

> browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.

## Headings are important

- `search engines` use the `headings` to index the structure and content of the your web pages.
- Users often skim a page by its headings
- it is important to use headings to show the document structure
- `h1` heading should be used for main headings

> use HTML headings for headings only, don't use headings to make text `BIG` or `BOLD`

## Bigger Headings

- each HTML heading has a default size.

```html
<h1 style="font-size: 60px">Heading 1 </h1>
```
